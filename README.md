# i3 config
Recently moved to gnome-shell, so I moved these out of my main dotfiles repository.

This also includes the scripts I used to use for `xrandr`, etc. 

## Setting up
Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/b-ggs/i3config.git
```

Create symlinks to `~` using the script provided.
```
./bootstrap.sh
```
